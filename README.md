# webpack-setup-demo

# Introduction

Project is setup to use Yarn 2 for package and build. You can choose to use NPM too which is the default mostly.

Read why Yarn 2 makes sense : https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/qa#why-should-you-upgrade-to-yarn-modern

If you do not wish to use Yarn 2 then move to section - "Setting up with Yarn 2"

## Setting up with Yarn 2

### Setup

npm install -g yarn

yarn set version berry

### Updating Yarn

yarn set version stable

This setup is all about how to use webpack setup for development & production.
