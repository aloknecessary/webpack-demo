# Introduction

Project is setup to use Yarn 2 for package and build. You can choose to use NPM too which is the default mostly.

Read why Yarn 2 makes sense:

https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install

If you do not wish to use Yarn 2 then move to section - "Getting Started"

## Setting up with Yarn 2

### Setup

`npm install -g yarn`

`yarn set version berry`

### Updating Yarn

`yarn set version stable`

### Installing Yarn plugin

`yarn plugin import interactive-tools`

This will help you to update the package in interactive mode using:

`yarn upgrade-interactive`

This setup is all about how to use webpack setup for development & production.
